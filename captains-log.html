<p style="text-align: left;"><span style='font-size: 14px; font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hello internet! This is my web diary. I might update this now and again with exciting tales about my life as a 16 year old creator from small town America! Sounds fun, right? I know it doesn&apos;t. But I&apos;ve got stories to tell! Hatred to express! Now you&apos;re gonna read this and you&apos;re gonna like it!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style='font-size: 14px; font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today is my first day as an upperclassman. Freshman year was hell, Sophomore year sucked, I hope Junior year can be a lot better. I don&apos;t know what will be in store but my classes aren&apos;t that bad so far. I&apos;ve got a composition class followed up by a drawing class at the start of the day, so not too shabby. I&apos;ve got some opps in my culinary class but it&apos;s nothing I can&apos;t handle. I got to do weights in PE, hopefully I get more chances to lift, but based on what the gym teacher told me, it&apos;s probably gonna be a sporty hell.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style='font-size: 14px; font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&apos;ve got B lunch and most of my friends are in C lunch, I sent an email to the scheduling lady and hopefully we can get that fixed. I&apos;m in Algebra II right now, pretty run of the mill. After this I go to choir, then world history, and then I&apos;ll be on my way back home. In reality my schedule isn&apos;t bad, I just wasn&apos;t ready for summer to end so abruptly. I&apos;m gonna work on music when I get home unless I get too tired and end up taking a nap. It&apos;s Friday, so, I can do whatever I want over the weekend.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style='font-size: 14px; font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe getting back in the school groove isn&apos;t that bad. I just want to have enough time for music and possibly a job, and really I don&apos;t wanna suffer like I did last year. I&apos;ve got high hopes for this year, and big plans for this page, I&apos;ll keep y&apos;all updated whenever I can. What sucks is every time I close my school Chromebook that I&apos;m writing this on, it erases whatever I&apos;ve written. This is take three.</span></p>
