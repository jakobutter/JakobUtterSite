    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Yung Ulcer EP is not a project for everyone. It&apos;s got a lot of foul lyrics and concepts that will set people off. To some it will be the worst music they&apos;ve ever heard, to some it will be &quot;FIRE ASF BRO&quot;, and to some it will be life changing and eye-opening. But to me, The Yung Ulcer EP is redemption and freedom from the music that I&apos;ve always wanted to make. I made my first rap songs in 2018, a lot of them silly and all over the place. On this project my ability as a musician has improved ten fold, but the concepts and ideas stay the same. This is the most immature music I&apos;ve ever heard and there&apos;s not a chance the songs featured will ever be heard on the radio, at the club, or performed at a high school talent show.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">Now, I want you to open your ears and your mind. Enter the world of Yung Ulcer and the wild life I encompass. Listen to the words I say, the ideas I bring to the table, and the twisted morals present on this project. One of the tracks is an Eminem mockup about a dead superintendent. The outro song is a fatphobia anthem. I don&apos;t wish any bad on the family of a late superintendent, may his soul rest in peace, and I don&apos;t hate fat people as much as Track 7 might lead you to believe. Some of the kindest and realest people I&apos;ve ever met are overweight. Yes there is a song called Toddlerf*cker. Contrary to the title, I have no intent on harming a minor. This is all part of the bigger picture, the malice piece, The Yung Ulcer EP.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Go into this project with a sense of humor, please. You are going to hear some very odd lyrics throughout the seven tracks. You are going to hear sexism, fatphobia, homophobia, the whole nine yards. I have been working on the concepts featured here since 2019, and learned a lot about myself, my music, and the world in the process. If you have any concerns, shoot me an email at <a data-fr-linked="true" href="mailto:jakobjamesutter@gmail.com">jakobjamesutter@gmail.com</a>. Thank you for your time, your patience, and your attention. Enjoy.</span></p>
