There was a massive round planet in the center of the clouds which was so vibrant and unlike anything else I had seen. It was beautiful and all I could do was stare. It&rsquo;d change shapes, colors, textures. But consistently it was truly a sight for sore eyes. <br>     When the bus came to a halt, I looked outside the window to see my house. Stepping off of the bus my legs felt like jelly, I fell between the tires and pushed myself onto the asphalt before I could be crushed. I gazed up into the now magenta sky and saw no planet. Rather, there was now a small red arrow. Reaching for my phone I began to realize a song was playing, Luvraw &amp; BTB - Anatato.<br>     From the ground I realized how insignificant my struggles were, how blind all of my foes were and how unimportant it was to look down on myself. There looking up at this arrow in the soft pink cloudy sky I truly felt at peace, and thought to myself, that maybe if I held this feeling close with me forever, everything just might be alright.&nbsp;</span></p>

The top part was okay, he had moved in well, but it had a circular basement that went all the way around. It was dark, musty ,crowded. The air was so pungent of smoke that it was hard to see at times. As he led me through I felt an increase of remorse, I was upset and uncontested with my dads place. I didn&apos;t think he was happy there. I think it started in a small apartment. That&apos;s where I realized my situation. Like a studio apartment with deep blues, browns, whites, yellows.<br>     There was an open hall like the community center. Lots of people were there. I was with some familiar faces and I had counselors I talked to online. I messed around and, with enough time I manipulated the world around me. This was a sensory, unlike anything else. I could feel and move my fingers and my body, I was able to feel myself breathe and look around. Just like real life. I was talking to people and it make sense.<br>     At some point I summoned in Mrs. E█████ to talk with me and I told her all about my life and my troubles. She listened to me thoroughly. At some point I was hearing all about this crazy festival that I was to attend with J████ , T████, all of these homies. We were going to go, J████ and I did DMT or something. I was so thrown off and out of my body. I was so far ahead of everyone in the streets, without moving my feet I was going down the streets so fast. No one was in my line of sight. I was alone and going down the road so fast. Eventually I realized what I was doing and was able to slow myself down. My body and feet became able to move at my will once again.<br>     I saw my friends and we went along on our way to whatever this event was. My idea was, it was Woodstock, and we were witnessing history.&nbsp;</span></p>
