  <div class="absolute">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was on the ride home from school when somehow I saw straight into the pink sky above me from my seat on the bus. There was a massive round planet in the center of the clouds which was so vibrant and unlike anything else I had seen. It was beautiful and all I could do was stare. It&rsquo;d change shapes, colors, textures. But consistently it was truly a sight for sore eyes. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bus came to a halt, I looked outside the window to see my house. Stepping off of the bus my legs felt like jelly, I fell between the tires and pushed myself onto the asphalt before I could be crushed. I gazed up into the now magenta sky and saw no planet. Rather, there was now a small red arrow. Reaching for my phone I began to realize a song was playing, Luvraw &amp; BTB - Anatato.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ground I realized how insignificant my struggles were, how blind all of my foes were and how unimportant it was to look down on myself. There looking up at this arrow in the soft pink cloudy sky I truly felt at peace, and thought to myself, that maybe if I held this feeling close with me forever, everything just might be alright.</div>

   <div class="pissfuck">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was with my dad at his strange new house. The top part was okay, he had moved in well, but it had a circular basement that went all the way around. It was dark, musty ,crowded. The air was so pungent of smoke that it was hard to see at times. As he led me through I felt an increase of remorse, I was upset and uncontested with my dads place. I didn&apos;t think he was happy there. I think it started in a small apartment. That&apos;s where I realized my situation. Like a studio apartment with deep blues, browns, whites, yellows.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an open hall like the community center. Lots of people were there. I was with some familiar faces and I had counselors I talked to online. I messed around and, with enough time I manipulated the world around me. This was a sensory, unlike anything else. I could feel and move my fingers and my body, I was able to feel myself breathe and look around. Just like real life. I was talking to people and it make sense.<br>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point I summoned in Mrs. E█████ to talk with me and I told her all about my life and my troubles. She listened to me thoroughly. At some point I was hearing all about this crazy festival that I was to attend with J████ , T████, all of these homies. We were going to go, J████ and I did DMT or something. I was so thrown off and out of my body. I was so far ahead of everyone in the streets, without moving my feet I was going down the streets so fast. No one was in my line of sight. I was alone and going down the road so fast. Eventually I realized what I was doing and was able to slow myself down. My body and feet became able to move at my will once again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw my friends and we went along on our way to whatever this event was. My idea was, it was Woodstock, and we were witnessing history.</div>

<div class="anal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like, going around this huge building. It was an apartment of some sort. I was curious of all the apartment rooms, and nobody was in them that I was aware of. I went into room #18 and it was an empty square room with a bunch of graffiti on the walls. Maybe there was a bed frame. I read some of the grafitti and one of them said something along the lines of "my wife had an affair with 4 men in this bed while I was at work" it was sad and I took a picture of it with my phone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I left the room Andy was with me, I looked into room #28 and it looked like someone had stuff in there so I was scared that I would get caught there or something. Me and Andy got on the elevator but Andy was really close to where the door closed so I had to bring him over by me. We went to the bottom floor for some reason and Andy went off. Like into the building commons and the parking lot. I was scared, I went to look for him. I saw him and called for him, he didn't care very much.

<div class="terror">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School was dark, and there was a big event going on with lots of people.  I had both my 3DS's and I put them down in a sand pit in a dark room. I asked L#### and someone else to stay and help me look for it, but to no avail. I was panicking and leaving the gym. I was having trouble making it back to that sandpit room once I did and there was four other 3DS's in the sand. I picked them up and J█████ told me they were his. We stored out which one was mine because of the sticker on the back.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was walking with the S███ W████ friend group. The Bad Omen ones. We were all going down from the gym doors back towards the commons. S███ had a plastic thing filled with liquid and she was poking herself in the arm with it. I asked what it was and she said heroin. I stepped far away from her. I didn't want her to poke me with the needle. She was talking to her friends about how cool the "heroin visuals" were. M██ poked herself with it. They stopped in front of the cafeteria entrance to shoot up. Mr A█████ watched them and didn't say a word. I walked in front of him and he had nothing to say.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went back to the sand pit room and grabbed my 3DS XL. it was on a table next to the sandpit. I walked out and headed back to my locker. Upon getting there my thinking felt abrasive. I couldn't see it was all black. Felt noisy. I just wasn't in control of my body. I was trying to find the locker that was mine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point I made it to choir. Instead of A████ it was M██████ sitting to the right of me. We were talking about B█████. I was asking her about transcending the barrier.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was running around the school with B█████. We went into the boys locker room and just chilled in a corner. Talked.
