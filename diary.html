<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;line-height:1.5;margin: 70px;font-weight:400;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#FFFFFF;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">I was on the ride home from school when somehow I saw straight into the pink sky above me from my seat on the bus. There was a massive round planet in the center of the clouds which was so vibrant and unlike anything else I had seen. It was beautiful and all I could do was stare. It&rsquo;d change shapes, colors, textures. But consistently it was truly a sight for sore eyes. When the bus came to a halt, I looked outside the window to see my house. Stepping off of the bus my legs felt like jelly, I fell between the tires and pushed myself onto the asphalt before I could be crushed. I gazed up into the now magenta sky and saw no planet. Rather, there was now a small red arrow. Reaching for my phone I began to realize a song was playing, Luvraw &amp; BTB - Anatato. From the ground I realized how insignificant my struggles were, how blind all of my foes were and how unimportant it was to look down on myself. There looking up at this arrow in the soft pink cloudy sky I truly felt at peace, and thought to myself, that maybe if I held this feeling close with me forever, everything just might be alright.&nbsp;</span></p>
